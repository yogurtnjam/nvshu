# nvshu

This repo contains the following files:
1. *cs72_fp.ipynb* - the Jupyter Notebook that contains all the code parts of our final project.
2. *cs_fp_outputs (1).pdf* - the output of our code if executed successfully.
3. *fp_groupwork (1).pdf* - a detailed explanation of how my partner and I each contributed to this project.
4. *ChineseEmo.tsv, NushuEmo.tsv, nvshu_Test.tsv, nvshu_train.tsv* - dataset from Ivory

How to run this file:
1. Open the notebook directly in Google Colab by uploading cs72_fp.ipynb or using the Colab “Open notebook” feature.
2. Download the four dataset .tsv files and make sure to upload them to the Colab runtime. You can do this via the file sidebar in Colab.
Run all cells to see the outputs. The results should look like the screenshots in cs_fp_outputs (1).pdf
